# Arduino project

Code for reading local temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor and logging data on ThingSpeak, in addition to displaying on OLED screen.

Look at picture folder to see results. 

Display ThingSpeak plots on mobile with "ThingView Free" app.

**TODO:**

    1. Add multiple frames to the OLED display
    2. Add support for other sensors
